        <p>A CSS class is an attribute used to define a group of HTML elements in order to apply unique styling
           and formatting to those elements with CSS.</p>

        <p>Imagine you're designing a web page. You want a group of headings to have a large red text, 
           a group of buttons to have a medium white text, and a group of paragraphs to have a small blue text.</p>

        <p>
            Bold choices. But, thanks to CSS classes, you can do exactly that. CSS classes enable you to 
            apply unique style properties to groups of HTML elements to achieve your desired web page appearance.
