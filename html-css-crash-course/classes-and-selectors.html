        <p class="first">A CSS class is an attribute used to define a group of HTML elements in order to apply unique styling
           and formatting to those elements with CSS.</p>

        <p class="second">Imagine you're designing a web page. You want a group of headings to have a large red text, 
           a group of buttons to have a medium white text, and a group of paragraphs to have a small blue text.</p>

        <p class="first">
            Bold choices. But, thanks to CSS classes, you can do exactly that. CSS classes enable you to 
            apply unique style properties to groups of HTML elements to achieve your desired web page appearance.</p>

        <p class="second success">
            The .class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a particular class attribute. 
            In order to select the elements with a particular class, use the period (.) character specifying the class name ie., 
            it will match the HTML element based on the contents of their class attribute. 
            The class name is mostly used to set the CSS property to a given class.</p>
